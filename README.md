# Miletus_Buildingcatalogue
Transforming Data from [Field Desktop](https://github.com/dainst/idai-field) for the [Map of Miletus](https://geoserver.dainst.org/maps/5764) on [iDAI.geoserver](https://geoserver.dainst.org/).

This repository exists purely for the purpose of transparency. It contains scripts that reformat the output of the Building Catalogue (*Bauwerkskatalog*) from the Miletus Database in [Field Desktop](https://github.com/dainst/idai-field). 

The purpose is to transform information from the database and merge it with other spatial data. On the one hand, the building catalogue is used to produce a map guide for the [Map of Miletus](https://geoserver.dainst.org/maps/5764) housed on the DAI GeoNode ([iDAI.geoserver](https://geoserver.dainst.org/)) (`R/import_transform.R`). On the other hand, the dating of buildings and walls is reformatted and merged with a vector dataset to make the visualization of all reconstructions and plans possible in the same map (`R/duplicate_drawings.R`). 

Feel free to use this as a model for similar projects, though reformatting is tailored to the needs of the Miletus Excavation and will hardly fit other data models. 

## Dependencies / Packages

Required packages are `idaifieldR` [(GitHub)](https://github.com/lsteinmann/idaifieldR), `tidyverse`, `rgdal`, `sf`, `utf8`.

## Funding
This repository was produced during our work for the [Miletus Excavation](https://www.miletgrabung.uni-hamburg.de/) in the course of the DFG/ANR-funded project ["Life Forms in the Megapolis: Miletus in the Longue Dur√©e"](https://www.kulturwissenschaften.uni-hamburg.de/ka/forschung/lebensformen-megapolis.html) headed by Christof Berns and Julien Zurbach.
